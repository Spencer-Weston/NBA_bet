## Usage



## Status: Minimum Viable Product

In its current status, the project operates as a concurrent whole. From the run directory, the user can either run the project at their leisure with run.all, or they can set the project to run daily with run.daily which schedules run.all to run each day. In this sense, it's a viable product.

The project is a minimal product for two reasons. First, it contains no other functionality and/or no method for propogating functionality through the run directory at run time. For example, the regression model has graphing functions available, but the user cannot specify graph generation unless they run the regression script on its own. Second, the project only generates predictions with a linear model on a specific subset of data. A fully functional product would allow the user to choose their desired data and model
